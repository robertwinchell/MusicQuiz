MusicQuiz
=========

App that uses Facebook API to Quiz users music knowledge

Final assignment from Social Computing class, it is uploaded as a zip as the original code was large enough to freeze my local 
cloned version.

The app takes user data from their facebook profile and plays music they would like, currently our music selection is limited 
because our database is limited but the more that is added to the DB the more accurate the playlists get.
